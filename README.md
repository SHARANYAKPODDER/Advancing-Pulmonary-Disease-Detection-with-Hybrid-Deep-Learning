# Advancing-Pulmonary-Disease-Detection-with-Hybrid-Deep-Learning

This thesis presents the development of a hybrid
deep learning model designed to improve the detection and
classification of pulmonary diseases through the analysis of lung
sounds. Leveraging the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) including
LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and BiGRU architectures, the proposed
model effectively captures both spatial and temporal features
in lung sound data. The study demonstrates that integrating
CNNs with RNNs significantly enhances model performance in
detecting adventitious lung sounds, a key indicator of respiratory
conditions such as asthma, COPD, and pneumonia. Furthermore,
the research explores the impact of bidirectional processing and
model complexity, providing insights into the trade-offs between
accuracy and computational efficiency. The results highlight the
modelâ€™s robustness and generalizability, suggesting its potential
for real-world clinical application in respiratory disease diagnosis.
